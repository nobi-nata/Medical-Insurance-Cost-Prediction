# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction-using-ML-and-Streamlit
 This is Machine learning project which based on various factors like age,gender,bmi etc.. ,predicts the Medical Insurance Cost.                                                 
1. Python Streamlit framework based website which helps in predicting insurance cost.

2. Deployed on Streamlit - Cloud based platform. (https://medical-insurance-cost-prediction.streamlit.app/)

3. Dataset is trained on various regression alogorithms like linear regression, logistic, random forest, gradient boosting, SVM and the best accuracy alogrithms is selected.
